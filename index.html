        This website is all about croissants: a buttery and flaky baked delight.

    <h3>A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape. It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.</h3>
